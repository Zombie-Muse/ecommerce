# E-Commerce Store
E-Commerce project for CIS 4250

<p>This was my final project for summer 2021. We created an online store from a template using ASP.NET. Our focus was on making the products page, SQL database, and a shopping cart. I used movies and television for the products, separating them in main categories (Movies, Television, and Streaming), then separated them into subcategories for each main category. </p>

<p> <em>Notes: Coding in Visual Basic was actually strange for me, but I was able to pick it up enough to finish the project. Considering we only had 5 weeks in the semester, this seemed impossible at first. Apparently, it was not.</em></p>
